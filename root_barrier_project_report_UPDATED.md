# Project report: 120 cm HDPE root-barrier trench with 50 cm “foot” (human-only access)

## 1) Goal

Install an **HDPE root barrier** along **~100 m** of planter length (split into **three sections**, two of them long and curved) to stop roots migrating toward a **wall and adjacent hardscape (tiles/path)**.

Design intent:
- **Vertical barrier leg** installed **to ~120 cm depth**.
- **Bottom “foot”** extending **~50 cm into the planter (away from the wall/path)**, encouraging deeper roots to deflect outward rather than toward the wall.

---

## 2) Confirmed constraints and assumptions

- **Access:** human-only; no ride-on or tracked trenchers feasible.
- **Alignment:** trench line must run **as close to the wall as practical** to minimise disturbance to existing plants near the wall.
- **Barrier contact:** HDPE must sit **flush to the wall and concrete foundation** (tight contact along the wall-side face).
- **Ground:** mostly soil but expect **rock/stone** typical of Malta.
- **Vegetation:** mature trees (~50–60 years), so expect **significant roots**.
- **Root behavior (assumption):** roots you want to protect predominantly go down rather than horizontally (still treat large roots carefully as they appear).
- **Crew:** **3–4 people**, one acting as team lead for depth/quality supervision.
- **Spoil handling:** not a focus for this report.

## 3) HDPE geometry and sizing (updated)

### Target shape
You want the barrier to be as **L-shaped as possible**:
- **120 cm vertical leg**
- **50 cm horizontal foot** (away from the wall/path)

### Correct sheet width (flat before bending)
If you form the L from **one continuous piece**, the *flat sheet width required* is:

**120 cm (down) + 50 cm (out) = 170 cm**

> Note: “170 cm” is the **sheet width**, not the trench depth. The depth remains **120 cm**.

### Practical sourcing note
Off‑the‑shelf “root barrier” products are commonly sold as **vertical rolls/panels** (e.g., 60–120 cm tall). A 170 cm wide sheet suitable for forming a robust L may be:
- a wider HDPE sheet stock product, or
- a custom barrier, or
- implemented as a **two-piece system** (120 cm vertical barrier + separately attached 50 cm foot strip).

Because you have **curves and joints**, the jointing method becomes critical (see Open Questions).

## 4) Recommended trench geometry

Key objective: keep the trench **narrow at the top** (to reduce disturbance), while creating only the minimum space needed at the bottom to seat the 50 cm foot **without creating an undercut “cave.”**

Recommended profile:
- **Wall side:** as vertical and clean as possible (this is the “reference face” to keep the barrier flush).
- **Planter side:** **gently flared only in the bottom ~30–40 cm** to allow the foot to angle out.
- **Avoid undercuts:** do not hollow out a shelf; that’s where collapses start.

---

## 5) Tools and kit (scaled for 3–4 workers)

### Core digging + rock
- **Narrow trenching/draining spade** (primary)
- **Compact mattock/pick**
- **Long digging/breaker bar (~150 cm)** for rock and hard layers
- **Narrow clean-out shovel** (helps remove spoil from depth and shape the bottom wedge)

### Roots (important due to mature trees)
- **Heavy loppers**
- **Pruning saw**
- Strongly consider a **battery reciprocating saw with pruning blades** for thick roots (faster, cleaner cuts; reduces the temptation to rip roots out)

### Backfill + protection
- **Hand tamper**
- **Tarps/boards/ply offcuts** to protect tiles and (if needed) temporarily support trench edges at short runs

### Suggested quantities (3–4 workers)
- 3–4× trenching spades
- 3× mattocks
- 2–3× narrow clean-out shovels
- 2–3× loppers + 2–3× saws
- 1–2× digging bars
- 1× tamper
- 1× measuring kit (tape, depth gauge/rod, marker spray/chalk line, string line)

## 6) Execution plan (manual method, short segments)

### Why short runs (5–10 m) instead of digging the full 100 m first? (added)

Working in short runs is recommended because it improves **safety, quality, and control** for your exact situation (deep narrow trench, close to a wall, mixed soil/rock, thick roots, and many utilities):

1) **Stability / collapse risk**  
   A long open 1.2 m deep trench is more likely to slough or collapse over time. Short runs reduce the amount of open excavation and the time it stays open.

2) **Maintaining “flush to wall” fit**  
   The wall-side face deforms as it sits open (crumbles/drys/slumps). Installing HDPE immediately lets you keep it truly flush, then lock it in by backfilling and compacting.

3) **Utilities management**  
   Utilities are easier to expose, protect, and work around when you only open a small segment. If you hit an unexpected service, you solve it locally without reworking a huge length.

4) **Large roots**  
   Root cutting decisions are easier when disturbance is localized. Long open trenches mean many exposed/cut roots and more chance of edge instability as roots are removed.

5) **Water and rework**  
   The longer an excavation is open, the more it collects water and the more spoil falls back in. Short runs reduce “re-digging.”

6) **Quality control & iteration**  
   You can refine your method after the first segment (bend/foot seating, joint approach on curves, trench widths) before committing to the entire 100 m.

### Phase A — Pre-work
1) **Utility planning & marking (must-do)**
   - Gather any available drawings/as-builts.
   - Use a cable/pipe locator where possible.
   - Mark suspected routes on-site.
   - Plan how you will cross or avoid each service before deep digging begins.

2) **Set-out**
   - Mark the three sections and the curved alignments.
   - Define the “inside” direction of the foot (always away from wall/path).

3) **Trial section (highly recommended)**
   - Dig 1–2 m as a pilot:
     - confirm rock frequency and hardness
     - confirm realistic trench width close to the wall
     - confirm root sizes and cutting approach
     - confirm the bottom wedge method for the foot
     - test your **bend/foot** behavior and how well it holds shape during backfill

### Phase B — Dig + install in short segments
4) **Work in short runs (about 5–10 m)**
   - Excavate to depth in stages.
   - Keep the wall-side face clean and vertical.
   - Shape the bottom wedge only where needed for the foot.

5) **Root handling**
   - Cut roots **cleanly** (don’t tear).
   - If you meet a very large root that seems structural, pause and reassess (see Open Questions: “stop rule”).

### Phase C — Barrier placement + backfill
6) **Install vertical HDPE leg**
   - Place HDPE tight to the wall/foundation.
   - Team lead checks depth and vertical alignment.

7) **Form and seat the foot**
   - Bend the HDPE to create the ~50 cm foot.
   - Place it into the bottom wedge pointing into the planter.

8) **Backfill and compact in layers**
   - Backfill immediately after placement for each short run.
   - Compact carefully around the barrier and above/around the foot to lock geometry.

### Phase D — QA as you go
9) **Quality checks per segment**
   - Depth achieved (~120 cm)
   - Barrier vertical and flush to wall-side face
   - Foot direction correct (away from path/wall)
   - No voids next to barrier (good soil contact)
   - Joints/overlaps installed as planned (once decided)

## 7) Utilities: practical handling suggestions

Because you have “quite a few” services, treat this as a first-class workstream:

- **Don’t guess**: drawings help, but verify on-site.
- **Use trial holes**: hand-excavate shallow “confirmation windows” where services are expected *before* deep digging.
- **Work “soft” near services**:
  - avoid pick/mattock in the last ~10–20 cm where a service might be present
  - expose by hand carefully
- **Support and protect**:
  - avoid leaving pipes/conduits spanning unsupported
  - if the barrier path conflicts with a service, plan a detail:
    - local offset of the barrier line
    - protective sleeve/duct where appropriate
    - service reroute (best done ahead of time if needed)
- **High-risk areas**: consider vacuum excavation/hydro-excavation if available and affordable, especially where congestion is high.

## 8) Safety note: stepping into a 1.2 m trench?

**Plan for “work from above” and avoid entry** where possible.

At ~1.2 m depth, trench collapse risk becomes serious in many soils, and narrow trenches close to walls are particularly unforgiving. The safest method here is:
- short segments
- no long open trenches
- immediate backfill
- tools that let you work from above

If you ever conclude entry is required, treat that as a different method statement requiring appropriate protective measures and safe access/egress, and expect it may force a wider excavation (which conflicts with your minimal-disturbance goal).

# Open questions (to finalise before purchasing materials or starting excavation)

1) **HDPE product spec**
   - can you source a **170 cm wide** HDPE sheet suitable for bending into an L?
   - thickness/stiffness needed to hold the foot shape under backfill
   - UV resistance needs (if any top edge may become exposed)
   - manufacturer recommendations for installation and joining

2) **Jointing strategy (critical; currently undecided)**
   - overlap length
   - how to secure overlaps (manufacturer tape, mechanical fixings, welding, etc.)
   - how to handle joints on **curves and corners** so the barrier remains continuous and flush
   - how to maintain the **foot continuity** at joints (one-piece bend vs separate foot strip)

3) **Top termination**
   - truly flush with soil or slightly above grade?
   - if flush, how will you prevent roots bridging over the top over time?

4) **Utilities map**
   - what services exist (irrigation, electrical, drains, etc.)
   - which sections are most congested and where trial holes should be placed

5) **Tree/root “stop rule”**
   - what root size/location triggers a pause and expert input?
   - do you want an arborist consulted if you encounter major structural roots?

6) **Foot formation detail**
   - is the foot formed cold (simple bend), or does it need heat-forming?
   - how will you prevent the foot from springing back during backfill?

7) **Crossing details**
   - standard detail for when the barrier line meets a service:
     - barrier offset, service sleeve, or service reroute
     - how to maintain barrier continuity at the crossing
