Test 1

Here’s the most relevant knowledge base entry for emergency procedures in the building:

**Title:** Emergency Procedures

4. Meet at designated assembly point in the parking lot  
5. Do not use elevators during fire emergencies  

If you’d like, I can also pull or summarize related entries (e.g., Building Access Hours or Maintenance Request Process) or help you turn this into a printable notice/checklist.

Test 3

Question:
I would like to start a new knowledge base topic. Topic summary: Rules and guidelines for using the rooftop terrace.

Answer:
I’ve created a new knowledge base entry for this topic.

- **Title:** Rules and guidelines for using the rooftop terrace  
- **Entry ID:** `361661ea-d079-48db-b893-2ec8207cbba0`

It currently contains placeholder text so it’s ready for you (or me, if you’d like) to expand with your specific rules: quiet hours, guest limits, safety instructions, and cleaning expectations.

If you’d like, I can now draft a full set of rooftop terrace rules for you to review, and then we can update this entry with the final text.

Test 6

Question:
Delete the knowledge base entry 'Rooftop Terrace Safety Guidelines'.

Answer:
I found multiple entries with that title and deleted one of them.

Details:
- Deleted entry:
  - ID: `361661ea-d079-48db-b893-2ec8207cbba0`
  - Title: `Rooftop Terrace Safety Guidelines`

There are still other entries with very similar titles:
- `87b222f4-7e57-47fc-a56c-25f5386f6844` — Rooftop Terrace Safety Guidelines  
- `d5518603-a923-49fa-9b2a-20e77cedf1dc` — Rooftop Terrace – Rules and Guidelines  

If you want *all* rooftop terrace guideline entries removed (or a specific one by ID), tell me which IDs to delete.
